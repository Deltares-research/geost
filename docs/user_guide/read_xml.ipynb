    "# Reading XML files\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how GeoST extracts data from BRO XML files and how extra data, that is not extracted by default, can be retrieved by extended the methodology of GeoST.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoST reads data from XML files by using a `schema` that describes the structure of the file (i.e. where to find specific elements) and determines where the information ends up in the resulting GeoST object, for instance a `BoreholeCollection`. Under the hood, GeoST uses the [lxml library](https://lxml.de/index.html) for the XML parsing which will be used in this tutorial as well to show some basic principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Borehole and CPT data in the Netherlands is distributed via a public national database: the BRO (\"Basis Registratie Ondergrond\"). The BRO contains five main sources of subsurface data: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Geological boreholes (BHR-G objects)\n",
    "- Geotechnical boreholes (BHR-GT objects)\n",
    "- Pedological boreholes (BHR-P objects)\n",
    "- Cone Penetration Tests (CPT objects)\n",
    "- Pedological soilprofile descriptions (SFR objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "Downloading any of the above data sources from [BROloket](https://www.broloket.nl/ondergrondgegevens) results in a set of XML files for the requested objects. GeoST can be used to read the data in the XML files for each of the data sources (see [available read function](../user_guide/reading_data.ipynb#subsurfacedata) for each object). Sometimes, XML data for one of the above objects may also be provided by companies (e.g. Wiertsema), which can differ slightly in structure compared to BRO XML files, but GeoST can work with these files too. For this tutorial, we will demonstrate how data is extracted from an XML file using a BHR-G XML file downloaded from the BRO but the principle is the same for the other data sources.\n",

With this schema, the most important header attributes (e.g. \"nr\", \"x\", \"y\", \"surface\") are retrieved and basic data attributes. For BHR-G objects these are attributes such as \"top\", \"bottom\" and \"lithology\". Anyone just interested in basic attributes or quick inspections can just use the default reader functions and does not have to worry about schemas or other things. The code below shows how easily the BHR-G file can be read. The result is a `BoreholeCollection` that contains a header and data attribute."

    "You may already recognize some of the header attributes that were in the `BoreholeCollection` above such as \"nr\", \"crs\", \"surface\". The simplest way to explain the above schema in relation to the resulting `BoreholeCollection` is that the \"data\" key determines what will be in the data table and all other keys end up in the header table.
