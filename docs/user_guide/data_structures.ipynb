    "# Data structures\n",
    "GeoST uses standardized internal data structures and data validation to ensure that the\n",
    "functionality that GeoST offers can always reliably be applied. This user guide section \n",
    "dives deeper into GeoST data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection objects\n",
    "As shown in the first [introduction](../getting_started/introduction.ipynb#concept) to GeoST,\n",
    "data is held in so-called `Collection` objects, the core objects of GeoST, which contain header\n",
    "and data tables. Basically, the two can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the *header table* describes metadata and spatial information.\n",
    "* the *data table* contains the logged data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header and data tables have a one-to-many relationship: one survey (e.g. borehole) is\n",
    "one row in the header and multiple rows in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically available types of subsurface data comprise point-like data such as boreholes,\n",
    "cpts, well logs and line-like data such as seismics, GPR, EM.  Different data sources are\n",
    "related to specific Collection objects. For example, borehole data is held in a\n",
    "[`BoreholeCollection`](../api_reference/borehole_collection.rst) and CPT data in a\n",
    "[`CptCollection`](../api_reference/cpt_collection.rst) (see figure below). \n",

    "    <img src=\"../_static/object_hierarchy.png\" alt=\"GeoST object hierarchy\" title=\"GeoST object hierarchy\" width=\"1000\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "While working with a Collection, making selections may alter the header and data tables,\n",
    "Collections automatically maintain alignment between the two. Therefore, users can safely\n",
    "make selections and analyse the data while being sure of consistency. It is recommended to\n",
    "work with collections by default, unless you specifically only need to work with the header\n",
    "or data table. By default, read functions for different types of data return a collection\n",
    "(see: [Reading data](./reading_data.ipynb)). So for example, reading sample data of boreholes\n",
    "available in GeoST shows that the resulting object is a BoreholeCollection. Additionally, we\n",
    "show that a Collection also contains horizontal and vertical spatial references."

One point or line survey (i.e. one row in the header) can be associated with multiple rows of data. E.g. a single borehole with 10 described layers is represented by one row in the header Geodataframe and ten rows in the data DataFrame. \n",
