    "## Header `.gsthd` accessor\n",
    "The [`.gsthd`](../api_reference/header_accessors.rst) **only works on Geopandas GeoDataFrames**\n",
    "which is related to different types of subsurface data that exist. Typically available types\n",
    "of subsurface data comprise point-like data such as boreholes, CPTs and well-logs and line-like\n",
    "data such as seismics, GPR and EM. This means that the location of different types of surveys in\n",
    "some cases are represented by a point and others by a line. In the design, GeoST aims to be\n",
    "as consistent as possible with creating methods (e.g. `select_within_bbox`, `select_with_points`)\n",
    "but under the hood, some methods may need to work slightly different based on the type of\n",
    "geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.gsthd` accessor automatically resolves the above need and figures out the correct method\n",
    "to use based on the datatype in the \"geometry\" column of a GeoDataFrame. This is done by determining\n",
    "the geometry type of the first row in the GeoDataFrame and selecting the required backend:\n",
    "for instance a [`PointHeader`](../api_reference/header_accessors.rst#pointheader) in case of\n",
    "point data and [`LineHeader`](../api_reference/data_accessors.rst#lineheader) in case of line\n",
