    "# Introduction to GeoST\n",
    "\n",
    "This quick introduction will cover some of the key concepts and basic features of `GeoST` to help you get started. `GeoST` depends heavily on popular data science libraries [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) and [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html) but `GeoST` provides readily available, frequently used selections on data held in [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html) or [GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/geodataframe.html) objects. This makes GeoST an easy to use option for less experienced Python users while more experienced users can easily access the underlying DataFrames and develop their own functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoST is designed to work with many different kinds of subsurface data that is available in The Netherlands. GeoST is a work-in-progress and aims to support an increasing number of data sources. Below is a list of different data sources which are currently supported or will be supported by GeoST in the future:\n",

    "## Concept\n",
    "At the core, `GeoST` handles data in a so-called `Collection` objects which holds all the spatial information of any kind of data source in a **\"header\"** attribute, and the corresponding data in a **\"data\"** attribute. So for example, a set of 100 boreholes is held in a `BoreholeCollection` where the **\"header\"** contains one row per data entry and provides information about the id, location, surface level and depths and the **\"data\"** has the information of each described layer. When working with these `Collections`, GeoST automatically keeps track of the alignment and thus makes sure each data entry occurs in both the **\"header\"** and **\"data\"** attributes. For example, when a user deletes an individual borehole entry from the **\"header\"**, the `Collection` ensures it is deleted from the **\"data\"** as well.  \n",

    "For a more detailed explanation of the types of GeoST objects for different sources of data, check the [Data structures](../user_guide/data_structures.md) in the user guide.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics\n",
    "### BoreholeCollection\n",
    "Data is usually loaded through various reader functions (see [API reference](../api_reference/io.rst)). For this tutorial, `GeoST` provides a set of readily available boreholes in the area of the Utrecht Science Park which can be directly loaded as a `BoreholeCollection`. Let's read the data, print the result to see what it says and also plot the locations to get an idea where we are:"

    "As you can see it says that 'usp_boreholes' is of the type [BoreholeCollection](../api_reference/borehole_collection.rst). Additionally, it says `# header = 67`. This means that the collection in total contains 67 boreholes but it also shows the first key attribute of a collection: the \"header\" attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "As said in the previous section, the \"header\" attribute in a `BoreholeCollection` contains all the information about each borehole such as the ID, x- and y-coordinates and further metadata. Additionally, it contains geometry objects for each borehole which allows for spatial selections and exports to GIS-supported formats etc. that are provided by `GeoST`. The header attribute is a [Geopandas GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/geodataframe.html) instance. Let's see what the attribute looks like by printing it:"

    "\n",
    "The other key attribute of a collection is the \"data\" attribute which is a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html) instance. This contains the actual logged data (i.e. layer descriptions) of the boreholes. In this case, the \"data\" attribute contains \"layered\" data because the borehole data is logged in terms of layers (i.e. depth intervals over which properties are the same) with \"top\" and \"bottom\".

    "- `select_within_polygons` - Select data points in the collection within polygon geometries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional selections**\n",
    "- `select_by_values` - Select data points in the collection based on the presence of certain values in one or more of the data columns\n",
    "- `select_by_length` - Select data points in the collection based on length requirements \n",
    "- `select_by_depth` - Select data points in the collection based on depth constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing**\n",
    "- `slice_depth_interval` - Slice boreholes in the collection down to the specified depth interval\n",
    "- `slice_by_values` - Slice boreholes in the collection based on value (e.g. only sand layers, remove others).\n",
