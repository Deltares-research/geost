# GeoST |version|


The Geological Subsurface Toolbox (GeoST) package is designed to be an easy-to-use Python 
interface for working with subsurface data of The Netherlands, allowing you to integrate
these data in your workflows for data analyses, modelling and visualisation. GeoST readily
provides commonly used methods for e.g. spatial/conditional selections, conversions and data
fusion, but at the same time remains fully flexible for advanced users to develop their own
functions around GeoST data objects.

GeoST is a work-in-progress and currently supports a limited number of data sources.
