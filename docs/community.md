Our vision for GeoST is to grow it into a widely-used open-source software package for those
who work with subsurface data and Python in whatever role or capacity. This we cannot do alone
and we therefore invite you to join us in using and developing GeoST. Contributions can be 
as simple as giving feedback and reporting bugs!
